            <div className="faq-header">Lark in Ennis 2024 FAQ</div>
            <div className="faq-content">
                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">What is the idea of this Camp?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">The Camp’s founder, Danese Cooper, also serves on the board of directors for an organisation called Lark Traditional Arts (LTA) that produces a famous summer world music camp in Northern California originally called “Lark in the Morning Camp” (but most people just call it Lark Camp). Since 2017 Danese has lived full-time in Ennis, Co. Clare, Ireland where she enjoys a lot of access to excellent Irish Traditional Music. She was surprised to learn that Adult instruction is generally treated as an afterthought at music camps held in Ireland, because the focus is on children and tweens. At the same time, bus tours led by famous musicians were enjoying a rise in popularity across Ireland, but especially in the West. Many of these tours were stopping in Ennis and those bus tourists who played music would generally want to play in Ennis sessions, often with limited success.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In 2022 the scope of LTA was broadened to include “Affiliated Events”, to encourage the Lark community to take inspiration and support from the LTA and use it as a starting point to create excellent educational experiences with the goal of spreading the joy of all types of traditional music, song and dance.
                    <br/><br/>
                    After experimenting for a few years with producing single-instrument weekend retreats for adults in Ireland, which was already a common practice, Ms. Cooper decided to take the plunge and try to bring a full Lark-style Music Camp to Ennis to provide the missing focus on Adult instruction for Irish Traditional Music, as an LTA-Affilated event. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    This first year the event will be run as a proof of concept, with an all-star faculty, an offering of ten 90-minute master-classes over five days for the most common instruments in a session, along with mid-day opportunities to attend lectures, panels, and daily concerts (or optional forays to see more of the sweet County Clare), and an evening session trail offering students the chance to play this music as it is most often played in Ireland…in a pub! Each student will also be ticketed to attend our Faculty Concert on 22 May at Glór, our local cultural event space.

                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">Why Ennis?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">We believe that County Clare has long been the beating heart of Irish Traditional Music, and Ennis is it’s county seat. As such we have more than our share of sessions, performances, annual events like the Fleadh Núa, the Ennis TradFest, and the Tionól for Pat Broderick, and many local residents who are deeply involved in the craft. Additionally, it is a charming town with 22,000 inhabitants, walkable medieval shopping streets, cafés, restaurants, the best Irish Music shop in the world (Custy’s) and all the amenities of a major town (hotels, ATMs, parks, public art, other services). And a river runs through it! Ennis is conveniently located a 10-minute drive from Shannon Airport, and there is easy transportation from Dublin Airport direct to Ennis.</div>
                </div>
                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">What does it cost and how/when will I pay?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">Lark in Ennis 2024 will cost €850 per student. That price includes snacks at the Orientation Meeting on 19 May, ten 90-minute master-classes, admission to two mid-day events each class day (TradTalks and Secret Concerts), a dedicated night-time session trail for intermediate players, a ticket to the all-star Faculty Concert on 22 May at Glór (and the option to purchase a companion ticket), optional short cultural tours, a centrally located Event Hub with dedicated staff to answer questions and offer help if needed, a shuttle bus route to help you get around town, a cool event tee-shirt and stickers for your instrument cases.
                    <br/><br/>
                    You will be required to pay a fully refundable €100 deposit via PayPal upon registration of interest. You will need to submit a video of your playing within a week of paying your deposit. If you are accepted as a student, you will receive an acceptance letter and a payment link for the balance of your tuition. Once you have paid that balance you will be set to book your flights to Ireland!
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">What is NOT included in the cost?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">You will be responsible for arranging your own transportation to Ireland, and to Ennis within Ireland. We will post a transportation tips page next week.
                    <br/><br/>
                    You will also be responsible for arranging your own lodging, car rental within Ireland (if desired), and you’ll need to find your own meals. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    If you’re bringing along a companion who wants to attend the TradTalks, Secret Concerts, and/or the Faculty Concert you will need to purchase those tickets.

                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">What is the cancellation policy?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">Before acceptance as a student, your €100 registration of interest deposit is fully refundable upon request. Once your balance payment is processed, we can only offer 50% refunds (€425) for cancellations of any reason. After May 1st, 2024 we can no longer offer refunds.</div>
                </div>
                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">What is the COVID policy?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">There are currently no restrictions on travel to Ireland for people with COVID, so you must travel and attend Lark in Ennis at your own risk and we accept no liability.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We will have COVID tests available at the Orientation and at the Hub throughout the week. If you feel poorly and test positive, please do the right thing and avoid infecting your fellow students and instructors by either a) wearing a mask in class or b) self-isolating until you feel better. Please let the Camp know of your status by texting 0852550057 via SMS, Signal or What’sApp.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Frequent hand-washing and/or use of hand sanitizers (available at the Hub and in every classroom) is highly recommended.

                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">Why is there a Code of Conduct?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">Our Code of Conduct was introduced at Lark Camp in 2019 and it has proven very useful for helping people think about interactions at Camp, and has given us a framework to react when people fail to treat each other well. When LTA created their Affiliated Events program, one of the conditions of affiliation was use of the LTA Code of Conduct and of the processes used at Lark Camp to record and respond to interpersonal issues at Camp.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Every camper must agree to the Code of Conduct, and anyone found to be in violation of the Code of Conduct may be ejected from Lark in Ennis Music Camp with no refund, but none of that will happen without a series of conversations first.

                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">How will the video uploads will work?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">When you register interest and pay your deposit you’ll be sent information about how to create your video and where to send it. We are using DropBox to collect these videos, and the file needs to be labeled so we know who you are and which class you’re hoping to join. Please read the instructions carefully to make sure we can efficiently evaluate your submissions.</div>

                    <div className="faq-question-answer">That is entirely up to you. Options include:
                        <br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li className='faq-question-answer'>
                                A hotel in Ennis (some of our local hotels are already fully booked for other events, but check Treacy’s West County Hotel, the Queens Hotel and the Woodstock Hotel)
                            </li>
                            <li className='faq-question-answer'>
                            A B&B in Ennis (these are homes that rent rooms and feed you breakfast and they exist all over Ireland and can be good value for money. A Google search for B&B Ennis Ireland will yield lots of possibilities.)
                            </li>
                            <li className='faq-question-answer'>
                            An AirBnb or VRBO in Ennis (of which there are many). You can find listings in the mobile applications or websites for AirBnb or VRBO.
                            </li>
                            <li className='faq-question-answer'>
                            Stay with a friend. If you have musical friends in Clare it’s worth asking if they have a spare room.
                            </li>
                            <li className='faq-question-answer'>
                            Accommodation outside of Ennis: There are several small hotels, vacation rentals, B&Bs and a few large hotels commuting distance from Ennis in Clare towns such as Corofin, Doolin, Ennistymon, Inagh, Lahinch, Liscannor, Milltown Malbay, Newmarket on Fergus, Shannon and others. The finest hotel in Clare is Dromoland Castle, a 10 minute drive from Ennis. There is a more affordable Dromoland Inn on the same property.

                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">Do I need a car?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">If you succeed in finding accommodation in Ennis proper you probably don’t need a car. A taxi from Shannon Airport to central Ennis takes 12-15 minutes. There is a new FlightLink bus service from Dublin Airport to central Ennis direct (no bus change) for which we recommend booking ahead but it’s a very comfortable service. We will be offering optional tours of the beauty spots in Clare by chartered vehicle over mid-day most days, pre-booking will be required. Taxis are plentiful in Ennis and parking is not, so not renting a car might be a winning strategy for some.</div>
                </div>
                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">Do I need to bring my harp, guitar, bouzouki?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">
                    Grainne Hamley our harp instructor will have a limited number of harps to borrow. She will contact her accepted students with more information after tuition is paid.
                    <br/><br/>
                    All other students will need to bring their own instruments, unless you have a local friend who can lend you an instrument.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">Why don’t you have beginner classes?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">
                        Again 2024 is a proof-of-concept year for Lark in Ennis. We would very much like to expand into beginner classes (and more classes of all types) in 2025 and beyond, but we had to start small to make sure the concept works. We’re focusing on intermediate players because most master-class instructors want to help already established players improve through their observations and suggestions about how to push through to the next level or how to resolve nagging issues.
                        <br/><br/>
                        It is a common practice at Irish music camps such as Willy Clancy Week in Milltown Malbay to hold in-person live auditions the first day so students can be placed in classes that match their abilities. We are evaluating whether asking students to provide a video saves us from wasting a day of potential teaching with live auditions.

                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">Is there anything planned for my spouse/companion who won’t be a student?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">
                    Yes! The TradTalks and Secret Concerts are one option (they should be interesting to anyone). Another option is our daily tour of the beauty spots in County Clare (this will require prior booking). We are planning to host a walking tour of Ennis several times over the week. If the companion has access to a car, there are many beautiful day-hikes through the countryside surrounding Ennis, especially up in the Burren. Galway and Limerick are each about 45 minutes away by car and there are bus routes to those places from central Ennis. There are several tourist attractions within easy driving distance from Ennis including Bunratty Castle, the Aillwee Caves, The Burren Smokehouse, The Burren Perfumery, Hazel Mountain Chocolates just to mention a few.

                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">What are the Secret Concerts?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">The Secret Concerts concept was developed for the Masters of Tradition festival in Bantry, Co. Cork and it works beautifully there so Lark in Ennis is trying it. These 75-minute concerts are a way to gain exposure to local musicians you may have never heard of and to appreciate some of our talented instructors playing with their friends in small groups. You won’t know in advance who will be playing any of these concerts. You just show up and enjoy. These concerts are also a way to give back to the Ennis community. Daily tickets will be sold through Glór ticketing at very affordable rates to encourage local attendance.</div>
                </div>
                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">What are the TradTalks?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">TradTalks are another concept borrowed from Masters of Tradition. These are conversations on topics important to Irish Traditional musicians. We intend to film all TradTalks so we can post them on our YouTube channel as examples of the kinds of conversations people can participate in at Lark in Ennis, which will also mean we probably won’t repeat any of this year’s topics next year so each one is a moment in time that in which students can participate.</div>
                </div>
                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">What is the Faculty Concert?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">This is a gala evening of extraordinary musicians playing in our local 350-seat cultural centre theatre, Glór. Considering our faculty this year it promises to be an amazing concert that will almost certainly sell out. Each student will receive one ticket with tuition, and will have the option to purchase one additional ticket for a companion if they mentioned that companion when they registered (it’s a required question on the registration form).</div>
                </div>
                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">Where will classes happen?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">
                    Because Lark in Ennis 2024 is happening just before the 50th Annual Flead Núa in mid-May (before schools let out), we have been forced to book classrooms all over Ennis. As much as possible all of the classes will happen in the same room every day both morning and evening, but there are a few rooms where availability depends on time of day. Your orientation packet will give you full information about where to be and when.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Next year Lark in Ennis 2025 will probably take place in June after school is over so we can rent a whole campus and keep everybody together in one place for classes. There are several good options, but for this year we’ll be dispersed throughout the town.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">How do we get around?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">Ennis is a very walkable town. It is mostly flat, and several of the shopping streets are pedestrianised. However given that there’s only an hour between the end of the morning classes and the beginning of the Mid-Day program of TradTalks and Secret Concerts (and lunch to be found within that Mid-Day too) we’ll be running a shuttle bus service to help people get where they need to go. Your orientation packet will have shuttle bus route information.</div>
                </div>
                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">Will there be a central place to meet other students between classes? </div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">Yes! Our local cultural centre, Glór, has a café that serves light snacks, coffee, tea, barista drinks, sodas, and even beer and wine all day. We will be using that as a hub every day with Lark in Ennis staff available to help students with any questions or problems they are encountering, a large whiteboard with latest updates on Camp, information about tourist spots in Clare and beyond & Session Trail booklets. There are ample restrooms at Glór and lots of seating for relaxing or noodling a tune. Some of the TradTalks and Secret Concerts will be happening there as well.</div>
                </div>
                <div className="faq-question">
                    <div className="faq-question-header">Will there be a Lark in Ennis 2025?</div>
                    <div className="faq-question-answer">
                    That will depend on whether we feel that the concept has been proven. Student feedback will definitely help us make that call. Students will be asked to give their impressions and feedback at various times during this year’s camp such as after a Class, after attending a Mid-Day event, after the Faculty Concert and once they’ve gotten home (about a month after the event concludes).
                    <br/><br/>
                    It is our hope that Lark in Ennis can help stimulate more opportunities for Adult Music, Dance and Song Camps at all levels in Ireland. We look forward to hearing what students think after attending this first camp.
